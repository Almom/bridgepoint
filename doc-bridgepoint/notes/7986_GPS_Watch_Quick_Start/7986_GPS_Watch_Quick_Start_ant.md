# GPS Watch Quick Start Change Analysis
### xtUML Project Analysis Note


1. Abstract
-----------
Currently three GPS Watch models reside in the xtuml repositories. One is in the
xtuml/bridgepoint repository and two are in the xtuml/models repository. The
goal is to reduce this to one model in the xtuml/models repository and provide a
way to launch this model from the BridgePoint Welcome Quick Start screen.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] [BridgePoint DEI #1](https://support.onefact.net/redmine/issues/7986)  
[2] [BridgePoint DEI #2](https://support.onefact.net/redmine/issues/7927) 

3. Background
-------------
In this section, outline the important points relating to this issue/bug that
the reader would need to know in order to understand the rest of this
document.
1. BridgePoint is often run in secure environments that are cut off from the 
internet, so we have long had a policy that we include all the necessary bits
instead of requiring them to be retrieved from the net.

4. Requirements
---------------
This section describes the requirements that need to be satisfied.  If there 
is an SRS, this section may simply refer to it.  Each requirement should be as 
short and simple as possible and must be clearly defined.

4.1 There will be one GPS Watch model and it will live in xtuml/models
4.2 The GPS Watch model will include Goals.  
4.3 Item 3  

5. Analysis
-----------
This section is only required if there is no preceding analysis note. If present
it sets out a brief analysis of the problem to be resolved by this design note.

5.1 Item 1  
5.2 Item 2  
5.3 Item 3  

6. Work Required
----------------
In this section, break out the consequential work (as a numbered list) needed
to meet the requirements specified in the Requirements section.

7. Acceptance Test
------------------
In this section, list the tests that need to be performed in order to
verify that all the requirements are satisfied.
