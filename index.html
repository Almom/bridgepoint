nightly build.  This is an eclipse extension.  To use this exit eclipse, rename the current BridgePoint folder 
that is under eclipse_extensions, and then unzip this in that folder.  This build contains plugins that have been
renamed from com.mentor.nucleus.* to org.xtuml.*, therefore you must also:
<li>1) In eclipse.ini modify the reference to the product to be xtuml.org instead of com.mentor.nucleus</li>
<li>2) in eclipse/links I modified the file name and changed the com.mentor to org.xtuml</li>
